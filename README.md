# beep

I was gifted a [Beep](https://www.androidauthority.com/beep-audio-343308/) back when I worked at [Nextbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nextbit_Robin). 
One of the things I was in charge of was making use of the lights on the back of the phone. As inspiration, I was shown a beep, and how the lights "dance" while music was playing.
Now both companies have gone the way of the Silicon valley dodo, but the ID of the Beep is just too good for me to commit it to e-Waste.

I've taken it apart, and now it's time to make it work again.
